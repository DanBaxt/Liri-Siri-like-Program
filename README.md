Liri is a Siri-like app, designed to accept commands from the user.

Enter movie-this with a movie and it will show information about the movie. May not work for lesser known movies that don't have much information about them.

Enter twitter-this to see a feed from a dumby twitter account.

Enter spotify-this with a song to get the band, album, and the year the song was released.

To run the app, clone the depository, and install the nodes. The individual nodes are "dotenv", "fs", "request", "twitter", and "node-spotify-api".
